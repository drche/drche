The above is SNGS6; utilizes seed points, growing, and pruning.
https://github.com/dhoule/CS533-Big-Data-Data-Mining/tree/SNG2.5(pruning)
The above is SNGS2 on the loosely coupled Rock cluster. I was trying to come up with a different idea for pruning that might be more efficient/faster than the SNG6 repo that could be used to improve the SNGS6 code. I was unsuccessful.

The SNGS1 implementation. The SNGS0 repo is based off of this one, but the next person should just create their own repo for a new SNGS0. They just have to change 2 lines in omp_main.cpp.
